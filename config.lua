-- DISCLAIMERS:
-- if part of the area of the screenshot isn't loaded yet it will be black
-- if the area of the game that is on one screenshot is too big everything that is far away from the player will look very bad, this only happens if centerOnPlayerCFG is enabled

-- this is the time difference in seconds between screenshots. This time difference isn't really accurate, as the amount of ticks per second vary depending on if the hardware is able to keep up with the game
-- default: 300 which equals 5 minutes
timeDifferenceCFG = 300

-- this is the amount of ticks per second; default: 60 for vanilla Factorio, but if any other mod changes the amount of ticks per second this will have to be changed accordingly or your timing will be off
ticksPerSecondCFG = 60

-- if this option is set to "true" the game time will be changed shortly while taking a screenshot so all screenshots are taken at noon; default: false
onlyDayScreenshotsCFG = false

-- if this option is set to "true" a message will be printed whenever a screenshot is taken
printMessageCFG = false

-- if this option is enabled all screenshots will be taken at the position of the player; centerOnPlayerCFG and centerOnPositionCFG can't be active at the same time;
centerOnPlayerCFG = true

-- if this option is enabled all screenshots will be taken at the specified positon; centerOnPlayerCFG and centerOnPositionCFG can't be active at the same time; default: false; { 0, 0 }
centerOnPositionCFG = false
positionCFG = { 0, 0 }	-- if the area at this position isn't loaded the screenshot will be black

-- this is the resolution of the resulting screenshots; default: { 1920, 1080 }
resolutionCFG = { 1920, 1080 }

-- this is the zoom factor of the resulting screenshots (as a double value > 0); default: 1
zoomCFG = 1

-- this is the directory inside the script-output directory of the resulting screenshots; the name of the screenshot will be appended to the end like this "script-output/TimeLapseMod/screenshotname.png"; default: "TimeLapseMod"
pathCFG = "TimeLapseMod"

-- name of the screenshots; default: "screenshot"
screenshotnameCFG = "screenshot"

-- the type of image file that will be created; default: ".png" --> tested file types: ".png" | ".jpg" | ".gif"
fileTypeCFG = ".png"

-- formatting string for the amount of screenshots taken; default: "%04d" --> for example screenshot number 1 will be called "screenshotname0001.png"
